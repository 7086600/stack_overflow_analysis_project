Goals: handle missing data in practice.

## Project Overview

There is a staffing agency that specializes in finding qualified candidates for development roles. One of their latest clients is growing rapidly and wants to understand what kinds of developers they can hire, and to understand general trends of the technology market. The organization has access to the Stack Overflow dataset, which consists of survey responses by developers all over the world for the last few years.
